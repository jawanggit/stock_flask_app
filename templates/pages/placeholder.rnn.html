  <h1>Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)</h1>
</div>

<p class="lead">RNN is a class of neural networks that uses an internal state (memory) to process a time-based sequence of inputs. </p>

<h2>Data Prep and Model Tuning</h2>
<p class="lead"> In order to run the dataset through a RNN model, the data needed to be normalized and converted from a 2 dimensional format to a 3 dimensional format.
  The 3 dimensional format required by the LSTM layer includes a timestep dimension which refers to the time window that the LSTM should use for making predictions. 
  Since the prediction model uses a walk-forward validation approach, the batch-size for thep predicitons is set to 1.

  The overall RNN architecture for the model is composed of 1 LSTM layer, 1 Dropout Layer, and 4 dense layers.
   A dropout layer was added to the model to prevent overfitting by randomly ignoring selected neurons during training.</p>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p class="lead">The RNN model generated POSITIVE returns, but returned ~ XX% less than a simple ‘Buy and Hold’ strategy over the 60 day trading period.</p>


<p class ="lead">Other Key Insights from the model:</p>
<li>RNN Strategy entered the market 21 days out of 60, which yielded a 12% return over the entire testing window.</li>
<li>Based on the days RNN entered the market, RNN generated on average over $X.XX more than simply buying at the daily open price.</li>
<li>The variance/risk with RNN was also 10% less than buying and selling at the open and close: .51 (GBR) vs .57 (Open/Close) </li>
