  <h2><i>Project Purpose:</i></h2>
  <hr />
<p class="lead">This project seeks to apply Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models
   to generate a trading strategy for Delta Airlines stock that can yield returns greater than a simple 'buy and hold' strategy for 1 quarter (3 months).
   <p style="font-size:12px; text-align: center;"><b>Disclaimer: 
    This project is entirely intended for research purposes and applying 
    the algorithms and/or trading strategies outlined below is no 
    guarantee of positive returns</b> </p>
</p>
  <h2><i>Key Features in the Data:</i></h2>
  <hr />
  <p class="lead">A combination of stock technical indicator and basic stock metrics were used as features in the the GBR and RNN model. To prevent data leakage, the 
    previous day's metrics were shifted forward in order to be used as feature for current day's
     prediction. For example, DAL's closing price on 1/1/2021 was used as a feature in the prediction for 1/2/2021.
    <p><h4>Technical Indicators:</h4></p> 
    <li>Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)</li>
    <li>Rate of Change (ROC)</li>
    <li>Price Oscillator (PPO)</li> 

    <p><h4>Basic Stock metrics:</h4></p>
    <li>Open and Close</li> 
    <li>High and Low</li> 
    <li>Volume</li>

  <h2><i>Evaluation:</i></h2>
  <hr />
  <p class="lead">The root mean square error (RMSE) was used to tune the models, but the overall return using the trading strategy described
     below was used to determine the optimal model. Details on each model's final parameters and results can be seen by clicking on its respective tab </p>

    <p><h4>Trading Strategy</h4></p> 
    <ol>Buy each day at the Predicted Daily Low. If the Predicted Daily Low is never reached, do NOT buy at all. </ol>
    <ol>Sell each day at the Predicted Daily High. If the Predicted Daily High is NOT reached, sell at the daily closing price.</ol>  
    
  <h2><i>Overall Findings</i></h2>
  <hr />
  <p class="lead">The GBR model provided the greatest return over the ARIMA and RNN models when applied to the trading strategy. However, it was ~25% less than the return of a simple 'Buy and Hold'
     strategy (Buy on Day 0 and sell at the end of the 3 months). 
     
     <p> <h4>GBR strategy does have key benefits over the "Buy and Hold Strategy":</h4>  
    <li>GBR Strategy entered the market 21 days out of 60 potential trading days, which yielded an impressive 12% return over the entire testing window </li>
    <li>Based on the days GBR Strategy entered the market, it generated on average over $0.60 more than simply buying at the daily open price.</li>
    <p style="text-align:center;"> <div><img src="../../static/img/GBR Returns vs Actuals.png" class = "center"></div> </p>
    <li>The variance/risk with GBR Strategy was also 10% less than buying and selling at the open and close </li>
